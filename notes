- Notes:

1) Store data in map where key is hash -> could shard internally based on hash range, i.e. hash_num/(max_hash/num_shards)
2) Once a node receives a new record, it should check with every other node that they have the record instead of each
node requesting new records.

Use a bitmask to determine which nodes are aware of the new operation. Use another bitmask to determine which nodes are
aware of distribution completion. Size of bitmask represents number of nodes - one bit per node.
0001000000000 -> 1111111111111 (completed)


3) If a node comes back up, don't start serving to clients until it has processed all backlogged update requests from
all other nodes.
4) Don't complete publish request until it has successfully been stored to more than one node? Prevents data loss in the
event of a node going down.
5) If all nodes have updated record, then we can flatten the operations to just one operation (depending on operation
types or time elapsed since last update).
